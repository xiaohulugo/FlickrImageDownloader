Requires:
 - python 2.7+
 - python-oauth2 package
 - python six package

1) Extract the archive

2) Install 
This package uses distutils to install.
After you extracted the archive and moved to the extracted directory:

$ python setup.py install --user # to install in $HOME/.local
$ python setup.py install --prefix=<path> # to install in a custom directory
$ python setup.py install # for system wide installation

3) Configure API keys
Two keys are provided by Flickr and api_key and a secret. To make your
application aware of these keys there are two methods:
 i  - use the flickr_api.set_keys(api_key,secret_key) function. 
 ii - create a flickr_keys.py file as follows. Create a file called
      $INSTALL_DIR/flickr_api/flickr_keys.py. Edit it so it looks like :

API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
API_SECRET = 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'

where x's and y's are replaced by the values provided by flickr.
